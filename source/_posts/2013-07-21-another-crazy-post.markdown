Every summer, our campus is renewed with the arrival of the incredible intern class. The energy is infectious, the frozen yogurt machine is quickly depleted, and passion is buzzing through the halls. They come from different parts of the world and they all have one thing in common – they want to make cool things. And that’s exactly what they will be doing all summer at LinkedIn.

We want all interns from the Bay Area to experience this feeling for a weekend, so we're excited to be hosting the 3rd annual [LinkedIn Intern Hackday](http://hackday.linkedin.com/intern/2013) on Friday, July 12 at LinkedIn HQ in Mountain View, CA. You get 24 hours to build anything you want, make new friends, learn new technologies, and bond with fellow interns from other companies. 

[Register for Intern Hackday III now!](http://hackday.linkedin.com/intern/2013)

There will be food, caffeine, free swag, a jam-packed [schedule](http://hackday.linkedin.com/intern/2013#!schedule), and [great prizes](http://hackday.linkedin.com/intern/2013#!prizes), including a $10,000 scholarship for the first place team. I'm also excited to be joining an [all-star judging panel](http://hackday.linkedin.com/intern/2013#!judges):

Last year’s [Intern Hackday winners](http://hackday.linkedin.com/submission/intern/2012) - including [Yuchen Zhao](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/yuchen-zhao/30/537/6a2), one of our judges - went on to start their own company, [Scissorsfly](https://www.scissorsfly.com/). What will you build this summer?
